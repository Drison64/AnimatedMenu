This page describes how to set up commands.

If dealt with correctly, it might look like something like this:

Commands:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;example:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commands:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 'message: &aHello %player_name%!'</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permission: 'animatedmenu.examplepermission'<br/>
The 'example' can be any name; it is not used for anything. It's just to sort things<br/>
You can have unlimited amounts of this, as long as they're all under the Commands section<br/>
Each of the below keys are not required

There are a few keys which you can customize it with:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Click-Type</b><br/>
    The type the click has to be for this section to handle the click.<br/>

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Shift-Click</b><br/>
    Whether or not this click has to be a shift click.<br/>
    If this is set to 'both', both shift and non-shift clicks will execute this section.<br/>
    Set to 'true', 'yes', 'on' or 'enable' to make this execute only on shift clicks. Any other value will execute when shift is not pressed.<br/>
